=begin

The variable below will be randomly assigned as true or false. Write a method named time_of_day that, given a boolean as an argument, prints "It's daytime!" if the boolean is true and "It's nighttime!" if it's false. Pass daylight into the method as the argument to determine whether it's day or night.

Copy Code
daylight = [true, false].sample

=end

def time_of_day (daylight)
  daylight ? "It's daytime" : "It's nightime"
end


daylight = [true, false].sample

puts time_of_day(daylight)
